# Development log
## Brainstorm
### Design requirements
- Minimalist (try to save room space, so that you can do it easily even on a mobile device)
- Responsive
- Intuitive, self-explanatory (avoid needing to put a help me section)
### Functionality
- Set and name tasks
- Click and drag task time blocks into a linear schedule
- Allow repeatable schedules or not
- Automatic voice pronunciation for the news task change
- Pause schedule
- Restart schedule
- Reset time counter
- Tasks total time counter
- Progress-bar through a scheduled loop
### UI
- 3 tabs
  - Tab 1: minimal timer, button like; displays current task, next task, time till next task (maybe also progress bar for task cycle, number of completed cycles, and total time spent so far on the cycles)
  - Tab 2: cycle schedule planning
  - Tab 3: elasped time on schedule tasks
- Schedule tasks list
  - Name of task
  - up, down, +, x buttons for shifting entries up/down and for adding entry at location and for removing entry
- Buttons
  - Repeat cycle button: toggle on/off button as an option (signify as toggle by giving the toggle symbol)
    - Alternatively do a 2 button toggle, one is repeat/other is not repeat
  - Set schedule button: clicking sets in new schedule and jumps back to the timer page, to which user can choose to start the cycle or not; and it clears the old schedules
  - Editing schedule buttons
    - Clear button: clears schedule entirely
  - All time measured in seconds
# Notes
- Currently bind cycle task times to cycle plan, i.e. your old task times of a cycle is cleared when new task begins; new schedule calls for entirely new time tracking
# Todo

  - [x] 0.7.0
    - Linking of timer task display, cycle schedule, schedule time record data object complete (use a single coordinated data object to contain the info ideally, e.g. under the App component)

    - Beep sound on task end unless disabled (as notifications api fails on android)
# Potential future code-related changes
- Thin down code, try finding a better way than using React.createRef for referencing methods of the timer, e.g. reset, stop, start
- Resolve the warnings that appear in console
- - App.js file is too large, shorten it down into components
# Potential future functionality additions
- Moving away from schedule page whilst in edit cancels your edit, let us avoid that
- Cancel chances to schedule button
- Make elapsed time update per second or be synchrous with timer instead of updating only upon task completion
- Clear schedule button: clears schedule entirely
- Warn that upon changing your schedule all will be lost to your previous schedule and the clock will reset
- Find way of storing user data, e.g. via google acount or facebook or whatnot so kinda like clockify
- Allow exporting of schedule cycle, current execution status, and task time counts to a json file to allow easy loading back (but ideally try to do the online account data store method)
- Allow tasks to have descriptions added to them; but the timing is still counted as under the same overall task (though records will show finer sub tasks under the main task time)
